# Notes

While this project is relatively straightforward, the prompt it is still letting things up to interpretation.
As such, design decisions were made:
- Both the "Director" and "Actor" concepts are virtual, they are in effect "Persons". As such a person can both be a director and an actor.
- Due to time constraints, the project will NOT include standard architecture documents, such as diagrams and complete description. Design choices will appear in the form of a pseudo Architecture Decisions Record, reflecting the questions that were takcled and the decisions that came with.
- While this is not a best practice, for practicality in this exercices, some test accounts will be seeded on startup of the app. And will permit to conduct tests.
